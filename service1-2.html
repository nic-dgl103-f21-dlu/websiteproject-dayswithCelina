        <h2>Waxing</h2>
          <p>Arabella beauty specializes in waxing and is an expert in this service.  Waxing is a semi-permanent process of hair removal, from the root.  Warm wax is applied to the hairs and removed quickly once cooled.  With frequent waxing, hairs will grow back weaker and eventually overtime will cease to grow depending on hair growth and genetics.  Arabella beauty works with hard wax and is known for fast, efficient, painless, and hygienic waxing services</p>

        <h2>Threading</h2>
          <p>Arabella beauty has mastered the art of threading.  Threading has been around for generations, and it’s known as an ancient hair removal process.  Threading involves a 100% cotton thread, which is pulled along unwanted hair in a twisting motion.  This traps the hair in a very small lasso, and lifts hair right out of the follicle. Arabella beauty uses the threading technique to shape brows and especially unwanted facial hair.  If you’re for something gentler on your skin, as an alternative to waxing, threading is a great option as it leaves you with little to no irritation.</p>
