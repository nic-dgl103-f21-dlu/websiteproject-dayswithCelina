    <h2>Website Evaluation</h2>
    <p>Websites are such a powerful tool for companies to use to help grow their business and make money.  <b>“If your website isn’t making you money, then it’s costing you money”.</b>
    <br>Here are some ways I think Ascent Physiotherapy’s website could be improved:</p>

        <h3>#1. Fonts</h3><!--h3 headings for each topic-->
        <p>Typeface and fonts have a huge impact on the continuity and professionalism of your website. Fonts should be consistent, easy to read and visually appealing.  The content of a site should display important information that your customer will use to purchase items, book appointments, or find a way to contact you.  Long paragraphs aren’t conducive, so it’s best to stick with short sentences with a maximum length of 60 characters.  Ascent Physiotherapy font is easy to read, however there are inconsistent typefaces and fonts within each page of the website. 
    <br><b> What I would suggest to do is:</b></p>
            <ul><!--unordered list for suggestions-->
                <li>Choose 1 or 2 different typefaces for the entire website.</li>
                <li>Adjust font sizes according to the information. </li>
                <li>Adjust the headings, small paragraphs, and bullet points and ensure they’re consistent across the website.</li>
                <li>Shorten paragraph lengths.  Information should be consistent about each team member.</li> </ul>

        <h3>#2. Colour</h3>
        <p>Within Ascent Physiotherapy’s website, there are very minimal colours.  Primarily all the font styling is done in black which looks very professional but is a little boring.  By adding 1-2 other colours within your website will add context and style to your website’s information and will be much more visually appealing. <i> This is also known as the “60-30-10 rule”.</i>  60% or the bulk of your website will be primarily 1 one colour, 30% would be styled with another colour and the other 10% styled as the third colour.  This will ensure a cohesive colour story and will help your website visitor to understand your content and navigate within the website seamlessly.
    <br><b>What I would suggest to do is:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose at least 1-2 more colours that are cohesive with the look and brand of Ascent Physiotherapy.</li>
                <li>Use the different colours to bulk content together and highlight important information</li>
                <li>Enhance the “book now” button with one of the chosen colours.</li>
                <li>Organize products and services with the 60-30-10 rule.</li></ul>

        <h3>#3. Images</h3>
        <p>It takes a lot of steps to create a well functioning website that customers can use, and Ascent Physiotherapy would benefit from making a few changes.  The things that are working within the website are good professional photos on the homepage and of the team members.  You get a good sense of who works there so there is an authentic feel to it.  However, on the “facilities” page, the images of the facility aren’t as great of quality and the pictures are slightly blurry. 
    <br><b>What I would suggest to do is:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Update the facility images, make sure they’re good quality and well lit.</li>
                <li>Create a Favicon using the company logo image.</li>
                <li>Input images for products offered.</li>
                <li>Update images on the header for images that are more related to the business rather than to the location.</li></ul>

        <h3>#4. Visual Hierarchy</h3>
        <p>One of the ways to improve the layout of the Ascent Physiotherapy’s design would be to add some stronger visual content that’s organized by level of importance.  You can do this by enhancing titles, adding colour, and creating space within the text.  There’s not a lot of text on some of the pages of the site but the text and information that is on there would be better displayed with varied visual hierarchy.  
    <br><b>What I would suggest to do is:</b></p>           
    <ul>
                <li>Include strong Headings on each page of the site.</li>
                <li>Rearrange the Homepage to have emphasis on the text, adjust the image size and input another “book now” option.</li>
                <li>Adjust font weight and sizes according to the importance of the information.</li>
                <li>Create blocks of text with shorter sentences for easy reading.</li>
                <li>Use the 1-2 colours to add some visual appeal but stick to the colour story.</li></ul>

        <h3>In conclusion,</h3>
        <p>Some other changes to consider, would be to take out unnecessary pages within the website add links to their social media pages if there are any.  Create more links for the “Book Now” button, so clients have multiple ways to book appointments.  Overall, Ascent Physiotherapy’s website is generally easy to use but they would benefit from updating their website.  I drew up some wireframes to show you how I would design the website.
